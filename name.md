# Etymology of **kkkolo**

The name **kkkolo** emerges from a deep etymological layer that unites ancient Indo-European roots of **motion**, **rotation**, and **dwelling**.  

The word **“kolo”**, borrowed from South Slavic languages (Bulgarian, Serbo-Croatian), traces back to Proto-Slavic *kolo — “wheel” — and further to the Proto-Indo-European root *kʷel-, meaning “to move, to turn, to revolve.” From this same root come Ancient Greek **κύκλος** (*kyklos* — “circle”), Sanskrit **चरति** (*carati* — “moves”), and English **wheel**.  

That very Indo-European root *kʷel-* also gave rise to the Latin **colō**, meaning “to live, to inhabit, to cultivate.” From *colō* came *cultus* and then **cultūra**, the origin of the modern word **“culture.”** Thus, “kolo” and “culture” share a common ancestral root — both carrying the ancient idea of motion and circularity, yet also of **settlement**, **care**, and **the making of space livable**.  

In this sense, **kkkolo** is not just a play on sounds, but a symbolic return to the primordial essence of culture as a **circle of life** — movement, interaction, continuous renewal, and the creation of shared meaning.
